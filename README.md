All sensitive data is removed including firebase credentials as well as reddit login and discord bot credentials. Also removed is the tasks I have scheduled through the discord.py api because the way they are accessed currently would allow a user to gain access to the tasks such as sending feeds.  The bot is currently not running but it setup to be hosted on heroku as I've done with bots before.  This will be updated.
